#batchsplit.R
Split the SNP matrix, into batches, if does not want split the SNP matrix, no need to run this file.

#rtopy.R
Change .RData into the form which python could use

#ls.py
The python file to implement our ls method.

#PRS-CS method
The implement of PRS-CS method follows exactly the step described by the following link: https://github.com/getian107/PRScs

#RF.py
Code to implement RandomForests model, need a well-perepared SNP matrix and trait vector, more details could be seen in the python file.

#interaction.R
Code for interaction analysis, need a well-prepared SNP matrix and trait vector, more details could be seen in the R file. 


#supp.R
This R file contains miscellaneous parts of the study, including truncate and transform p-value, plot setting, and so on.
