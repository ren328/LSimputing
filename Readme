#batchsplit.R
Split the SNP matrix, into batches if does not want split the SNP matrix, no need to look at this file.

#rtopy.R
This is an R file which is used in ls.py to change .RData to the format which python file could use, if the snp matrix is not in .RData file, no need to use this file.

#ls.py
The python file to implement our ls method.

#gety.py
To get the imputed trait value after getting the result of ls.py.

#PRS-CS method
The implement of PRS-CS method follows exactly the step described by the following link: https://github.com/getian107/PRScs

#RF.py
Code to implement RandomForests model.

#interaction.R
Code for interaction analysis.

#cholesky.py
Code to perform cholesky decomposition.

#supp.R
This R file contains miscellaneous parts of the study, including truncate and transform p-value, plot setting, and so on.
